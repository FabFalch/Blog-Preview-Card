# Blog Preview Card Challenge

## Quick Description

This is a challenge on Frontend Mentor to build out a Blog Preview Card as close as possible to the design provided. Some hover effects included.

Frontend Mentor has provided both Desktop and Mobile designs in the design folder aswell as the design specs and images. A figma file has been included also.

## Resources Used
+ HTML
+ CSS

## What I've Learnt Throughout The Challenge

A small challenge like this is great for me to practise using figma to build a design. I've learnt a bit about :hover in CSS aswell as box-shadows. Tools like this will prove usefull in later projects.
